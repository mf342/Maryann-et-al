Figure 1: This image is created using Synthetic data from NASA JPL Horizons System (hereafter _Horizons_) (https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/). We queried the astrometric position of asteroid 2024 ON on September 5-6, 2024 with seperations of 1 hour, totalling 48 observations. In the top image, is the raw data showing the asteroids motion and the bottom image shows the subtraction of the asteroids motion from the Earth's rotation, with 20 mas noise. The 'pink highlighted region is the time-period of the real-time observations as seem from the PROMPT telescope, explained more in detail in Figure 6. The dataset downloaded from _Horizons_ and the code used to make this plot is attached in folder 'Figure 1'.

Figure 2: Similarily, asteroid 4953, as seen in Figure 2, was also created using Synthetic data from _Horizons_ over two days from October 30-31, 2024 with one hour sepertaions, totalling 48 observations, with 20 mas noise. The highlighed pink region is the time-frame when real-time observations were taken of the asteroid on October 31, 2024 as seen in Figure 7. The dataset downloaded from _Horizons_ and the code used to make this plot is attached in folder 'Figure 2'.

Figure 3: In this figure, we used 20 asteroids downloaded from _Horizons_. Timeframe: September 5-6, 2024 from 11:45 am - 3:30 am UTC, with added 20 mas noise. Since the observations are over a short arc, column 1 shows better distance measurements as compared to column 2. The dataset downloaded from _Horizons_ and the code used to make this plot is attached in folder 'Figure 3'.

Figure 4: In this figure, we used the same 20 asteroids as seen in figure 3, but increased the time span of the observations from a single night to multiple nights, downloaded from _Horizons_. Timeframe: September 5-9, 2024, three observations per night, totalling 15 observations, from 8 pm - 5 am UTC, with added 20 mas noise. Since the observations are over a longer arc, column 2 shows better distance measurements as compared to column 1. The dataset downloaded from _Horizons_ and the code used to make this plot is attached in folder 'Figure 4'.

Figure 5, Table 1: Here, in this image, we show the comparism of the real-time observations of the two asteroids, discussed in Figure 1 and 2, in the pink highligted region. On the x-axis we compare the predicted RA taken from Horizons, corresponding to the same time (or near the closest time) in the real-time observations we took using the PROMPT telescope in Chile. In the insets images, we show the residuals between the predicted versus the observed data. The dataset downloaded from _Horizons_ and the real-time observations used to make this plot is attached in folder 'Figure 5, Table 1'.

Figure 6, Table 2: In this figure, we show the real-time observation of asteroid 2024 ON, using the PROMPT telescope in Chile. The asteroid was observed for ~4 hours within a single night. Using Eq. 1 in the paper, we received an error of 0.62% after comparism with _Horizons_ data. The dataset downloaded from _Horizons_ and the real-time observations used to make this plot is attached in folder 'Figure 6, Table 2'.

Figure 7, Table 3: In this figure, we show the real-time observation of asteroid 2024 ON, using the PROMPT telescope in Chile. The asteroid was observed for ~7 hours within a single night. Using Eq. 1 in the paper, we received an error of 2.61% after comparism with _Horizons_ data. The dataset downloaded from _Horizons_ and the real-time observations used to make this plot is attached in folder 'Figure 7, Table 3'.
