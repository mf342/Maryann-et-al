This image is created using Synthetic data from NASA JPL Horizons System (hereafter _Horizons_) (https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/). We queried the astrometric position of asteroid 2024 ON on September 5-6, 2024 with seperations of 1 hour, totalling 48 observations. In the top image, is the raw data showing the asteroids motion and the bottom image shows the subtraction of the asteroids motion from the Earth's rotation. The 'light pink highlighted region is the time-period of the real-time observations as seem from the PROMPT telescope as seen in Figure 6. The dataset downloaded from _Horizons_ and the code used to make this plot is attached in folder 'Figure 1'. 

Figgure 2:

Similarily, asteroid 4953, as seen in Figure 2, was also created using Synthetic data from _Horizons_ over two days from October 30-31, 2024 with one hour sepertaions, totalling 48 observations. The Highlighed pink region is the time-frame when real-time observations were taken of the asteroid on October 31, 2024 as seen in Figure 7. The dataset downloaded from _Horizons_ and the code used to make this plot is attached in folder 'Figure 2'.
